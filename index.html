        <h2>Luxury</h2>
        <p>
          Ever since I was thirteen years old, my birthday present from my parents was to go have a high tea in a luxury hotel. I have always been fascinated with the exceptional customer experience that is provided in the luxury industry, as well as the necessary attention to detail. It is such a unique sector, that truly piqued my interest and I would like to work in in the future.

        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>
          I have always been passionate about music. I grew up in an environment where music played a central part, and have started playing the piano at six years old. I even decided to take music electives in my previous university, and spend several hours listening to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/agathe-mrt?si=80ccb1b9bba24841" target="_blank">my playlists on Spotify</a> every single day.

        <h2>Travel</h2>
        <p>
          Even though I grew up in Paris until the end of high school, I have had the opportunity to travel a lot: I studied in Canada before coming to HEC, did an exchange semester in Singapore, a summer course in Florence... I try to seize every opportunity I can to travel and discover new cultures, which I intend to keep doing so in the future.
